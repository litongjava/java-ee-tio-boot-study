用于查询课程信息的SQL语句,数据的是postgresql,数据表是course
数据表的创表语句如下
CREATE TABLE "public"."course" (
  "id" "pg_catalog"."int8" NOT NULL,
  "institution" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "term" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "subject_abbr" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "subject_name" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "focus_on" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "crn" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "course" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "section" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "title" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "credits" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "instructor" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "curr_enrolled" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "seats_avail" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "curr_waitlisted" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "wait_avail" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "days" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "time" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "room" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "dates" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "details_url" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "sources_url" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "creator" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "create_time" "pg_catalog"."timestamp",
  "updater" "pg_catalog"."varchar" COLLATE "pg_catalog"."default",
  "update_time" "pg_catalog"."timestamp",
  "deleted" "pg_catalog"."int2" DEFAULT 0,
  "tenant_id" "pg_catalog"."int8" DEFAULT 1
);


示例sql 
SELECT * FROM course WHERE institution='KAP' and term='Fall 2024' AND course='LAW 101' LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0
